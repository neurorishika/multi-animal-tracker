- `posekit/core/extensions.py` — `cluster_kfold_split`, `save_split_files` (orphaned after `DatasetSplitDialog` deletion) ✅
- `core/identity/runtime_utils.py` — `_resize_crop` (orphaned after `SleapExportBackend` removal) ✅

## False positives (deliberately excluded)

| Category | Reason |
|---|---|
| All `classkit/` findings | P1 planned features per `CLASSKIT.MD`; stubs intentionally incomplete |
| `wheelEvent`, `paint` DC04 methods | Qt dynamic dispatch — called by Qt event system, not Python code |
| `forward` DC04 methods (`head_models.py`) | PyTorch `nn.Module` dynamic dispatch |
| All DC05 `self.*` attributes | State fields for debugging/introspection/external access; set but not read internally |
| `_apply_brightness_contrast_numba` | Defined conditionally inside `if NUMBA_AVAILABLE:` block |
| `POSE_EXPORT_COLUMNS` (`properties_export.py`) | Backward-compatible alias; comment in file explains intent |
| `benchmark` (`runtime_types.py`) | Protocol interface definition — not an implementation |
| `InferenceRuntimeManager`, `closed_ms` (`runtime_manager.py`) | Live class with lifecycle role; `closed_ms` written in `close()` for metrics |
