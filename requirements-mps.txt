# Apple Silicon (MPS) optimized packages for multi-animal-tracker
# Install with: uv pip install -v -r requirements-mps.txt
#
# Compatible with: M1, M2, M3, M4 chips (macOS 12.3+)
# Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) backend provides GPU acceleration via PyTorch

# PyTorch with MPS support (native Apple Silicon)
# MPS is automatically detected and used when available
# No extra index URL needed - standard PyTorch includes MPS
torch
torchvision
torchaudio

# Computer vision & deep learning
timm
pupil-apriltags
ultralytics

# ONNX for model export (CPU version - no ONNX runtime GPU for MPS yet)
onnx
onnxslim
onnxruntime  # CPU version, but optimized for ARM64

# NOTE: The following are NOT available for Apple Silicon:
# - CuPy (NVIDIA CUDA only)
# - TensorRT (NVIDIA only)
# - ROCm (AMD only)
#
# PyTorch MPS backend provides GPU acceleration for:
# - YOLO inference (~2-3× speedup vs CPU)
# - Neural network operations
#
# Background subtraction remains CPU-based (Numba-optimized)

# Install this package in editable mode
