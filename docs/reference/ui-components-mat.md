# UI Components Reference (MAT)

This reference describes the Multi-Animal-Tracker UI by tab, with practical guidance for selecting values.

## How To Use This Page

- Read one tab at a time in the same order you configure the app.
- Start from defaults, then tune only the controls that match your failure mode.
- Use one controlled video segment as your calibration clip before full runs.

## Global Layout

### Video / ROI Panel

| Feature | Role | How to use it |
|---|---|---|
| ROI mode and zone type | Define where tracking is valid (include) and invalid (exclude). | Draw include zones first, then subtract problematic zones. |
| ROI shape controls | Add, confirm, undo, clear ROI geometry. | Confirm each shape before adding the next one. |
| Crop Video to ROI | Creates a cropped video for faster tracking. | Use when ROI occupies a small fraction of frame area. |
| Timeline + playback controls | Frame-level inspection before running tracking. | Scrub and inspect crossings/occlusions before choosing frame range. |
| Tracking frame range controls | Limit processing to specific interval. | Start after setup transients, end before unusable tails. |
| Zoom and pan tools | Pixel-level inspection for ROI and detection checks. | Use before setting body size and threshold parameters. |

### Action Panel

| Feature | Role | How to use it |
|---|---|---|
| Preview Mode | Short run for quick parameter validation. | Use on a short calibration clip first. |
| Start Full Tracking | Full pipeline execution. | Run only after preview metrics and visual checks look stable. |
| Progress / FPS / ETA | Runtime visibility and performance monitoring. | Watch for sudden FPS collapse after parameter changes. |

## Tab 1: Setup

### Purpose
Define files, timing basis, and core runtime behavior.

### Key Controls

| Control | Role | Value selection guidance | Common failure mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| Input video | Source media path. | Use the exact file used for analysis and keep path stable. | Wrong file variant causes non-reproducible runs. |
| Acquisition FPS | Temporal scaling basis for velocities and durations. | Use true acquisition FPS, not assumed playback FPS. | Wrong FPS distorts motion thresholds and lifecycle timing. |
| CSV output | Final tabular output path. | Use per-video output folders. | Overwriting prior runs without versioning. |
| Config load/save | Persist and reuse tuning. | Save per organism/setup profile. | Reusing configs across incompatible setups. |
| Processing resize factor | Speed-vs-detail tradeoff. | Lower for speed, raise for tiny animals/dense scenes. | Over-downscaling misses small animals and shape detail. |
| Save confidence columns | Adds detector/assignment confidence to output. | Keep enabled when QA or active learning is planned. | Losing confidence diagnostics needed for troubleshooting. |
| Use cached detections | Reuse existing detection cache. | Enable while iterating post-processing/tracking logic. | Stale cache after detection-setting changes. |
| Visualization-free mode | Faster processing by reducing UI rendering work. | Enable for large batch runs after validation. | Expecting real-time visual feedback while enabled. |

## Tab 2: Detection

### Purpose
Configure animal detection quality and robustness to lighting/background changes.

### Key Controls

| Control group | Includes | How to choose values | Common failure mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| Detection backend | Method, compute device | Use background subtraction in controlled arenas; YOLO OBB in complex backgrounds. | Wrong method yields either noisy masks or missed animals. |
| Image adjustments | Brightness, contrast, gamma | Use minimal adjustments needed to stabilize separation. | Over-adjustment amplifies noise or clips detail. |
| Background model | Priming frames, adaptive background, learning rate, subtraction threshold | Increase priming in variable lighting; keep learning rate conservative. | Adaptive background absorbing animals over time. |
| Lighting stabilization | Enable, smooth factor, median window | Enable only when illumination drift is real and gradual. | Over-smoothing suppresses real scene changes. |
| Morphology and contours | Kernel size, min area, max contour multiplier | Tune to reject speckle while preserving true animal silhouettes. | Kernel too large removes small/close animals. |
| Conservative split and dilation | Split kernel/iters, merge threshold, extra dilation | Use when merged blobs occur frequently in close interactions. | Over-splitting single animals into fragments. |
| YOLO settings | Model, path, confidence, IoU, classes | Raise confidence for precision; adjust IoU for neighbor separation. | Low confidence floods downstream with false positives. |
| GPU/batching/TensorRT | Batch mode, batch size, TensorRT options | Increase only after baseline correctness is validated. | Throughput tuning before correctness creates hidden errors. |

## Tab 3: Tracking

### Purpose
Define association, motion prediction, and track lifecycle logic.

### Key Controls

| Control group | Includes | How to choose values | Common failure mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| Core assignment | Max targets, assignment distance, recovery distance, backward tracking | Scale distance terms by realistic body-size movement. | Distances too large increase identity swaps. |
| Kalman tuning | Process noise, measurement noise, velocity damping, maturity settings | Raise process noise for erratic motion; raise measurement noise for jittery detections. | Filters lagging or oscillating due to bad noise balance. |
| Assignment weights | Position, orientation, area, aspect ratio weights | Start with position-dominant weighting, then add shape/orientation constraints. | Overweighting weak features destabilizes matches. |
| Motion logic | Motion velocity threshold, instant flip, orientation limits | Set threshold above jitter floor and below real locomotion. | Noise interpreted as movement. |
| Lifecycle | Lost frames threshold, respawn distance | Increase lost-frame tolerance only for real occlusion durations. | Fragmentation (too low) or ghost tracks (too high). |
| Stabilization gates | Min detections to start, min detect frames, min tracking frames | Use to prevent premature tracking on unstable startup data. | Starting tracking before signal stabilizes. |

## Tab 4: Processing

### Purpose
Clean trajectories, interpolate gaps, and configure final visualization outputs.

### Key Controls

| Control group | Includes | How to choose values | Common failure mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| Post-processing gates | Min trajectory length, max velocity break, max occlusion gap | Use organism-specific motion bounds and occlusion duration priors. | Over-aggressive cleanup removing valid behavior segments. |
| Velocity z-score filter | Threshold, window, min velocity | Enable when sporadic spikes remain after tracking. | Filtering out true bursts in high-speed species. |
| Interpolation | Method, max gap | Keep gap small; linear first, spline only when warranted. | Hallucinated paths over long missing intervals. |
| Merge/refinement | Agreement distance, overlap frames | Tighten only when merges across neighbors are common. | Merging unrelated tracks under dense conditions. |
| Video output | Render toggle, labels/orientation/trails, marker/text/arrow sizing | Enable for QA/reporting; disable for speed-focused production. | High-cost renders slowing full runs. |
| Histograms | Enable and history window | Use medium windows for responsive but stable monitoring. | Window too large hiding short-term quality collapse. |

## Tab 5: Dataset Generation

### Purpose
Export selective training frames and metadata for downstream model training.

### Key Controls

| Control | Role | How to choose values | Common failure mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dataset name/class name | Dataset identity metadata. | Use stable naming by experiment and version. | Name collisions across exports. |
| Output directory | Export destination. | Keep dataset exports isolated per run. | Mixing multiple runs into one folder. |
| Max frames to export | Dataset size cap. | Start small, inspect quality, then scale. | Large low-quality exports reduce annotation efficiency. |
| Frame quality threshold | Candidate filtering gate. | Raise for precision, lower for diversity. | Over-filtering rare but important edge cases. |
| Diversity window | Temporal diversity control. | Increase to avoid near-duplicate adjacent frames. | Redundant frame-heavy exports. |
| Context frames | Include neighboring frames. | Enable for temporal tasks; disable for static keypoint tasks. | Unnecessary storage growth without modeling benefit. |
| Sampling strategy | Deterministic vs probabilistic selection behavior. | Use deterministic for reproducible baselines. | Inconsistent datasets across reruns. |

## Tab 6: Individual Analysis

### Purpose
Configure identity-focused crop generation and identity-method settings.

### Key Controls

| Control group | Includes | How to choose values | Common failure mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| Output configuration | Dataset name, output directory, image format, save interval | Use PNG for lossless quality when storage permits. | JPEG artifacts degrading downstream learning. |
| Crop geometry | Padding fraction, min/max crop sizing, crop multipliers | Use just enough context to include full animal geometry. | Over-padding introduces background bias. |
| Background handling | Background color selection | Keep background consistent across exports. | Mixed background conventions across datasets. |
| Identity method settings | Method, model file/confidence, tag family/decimate | Match method to physical markers in footage. | Method-marker mismatch causing low-confidence identities. |

## Practical Tuning Order

1. Setup (video, FPS, resize, output paths)
2. Detection (method, thresholds, morphology)
3. Tracking (assignment + lifecycle)
4. Processing (cleanup + interpolation)
5. Dataset/Individual analysis exports
