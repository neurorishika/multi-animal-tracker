# Troubleshooting

## MAT Issues

## App starts but tracking quality is poor

- Re-check `reference_body_size` calibration.
- Verify detection mode choice for your scene type.
- Run detection preview on multiple representative frames.

## Tracks swap identities at crossings

- Enable backward tracking + merge.
- Reduce assignment gate if false pairings occur.
- Inspect confidence and uncertainty outputs.

## Runtime is too slow

- Lower `resize_factor`.
- Disable non-essential real-time overlays/histograms.
- Verify backend detection (`multi_tracker.utils.gpu_utils`).

## PoseKit Issues

## Labeler opens but project behaves inconsistently

- Confirm project keypoint schema matches existing labels.
- Run with `--new` to force explicit setup when needed.

## Model-assisted features fail

- Verify environment has expected ML dependencies.
- Check device selection (`auto/cpu/cuda/mps`) and memory constraints.

## General Diagnostics

- Check session logs generated by GUI components.
- Reduce workflow to smallest reproducible video/frame subset.
- Keep intermediate CSVs and settings snapshots when reporting issues.
