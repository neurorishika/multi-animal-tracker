# ClassKit

ClassKit is the classification and embedding toolkit, launched via `classkit`.

## Purpose

Build identity classifiers from animal crops using embedding models, clustering, and active learning.

## Launch

```bash
classkit
```

## Workflow

1. Create or open a project with source image directories.
2. Ingest and embed crops using a backbone model.
3. Cluster embeddings and visualize with UMAP.
4. Label identity classes manually or via AprilTag auto-labeling.
5. Train a classification head and evaluate results.
6. Export labeled datasets for downstream use.

## Key Features

- Embedding extraction with configurable backbone models
- UMAP-based dimensionality reduction and visualization
- FAISS-powered similarity search and clustering
- AprilTag auto-labeling for marker-based identity assignment
- Active learning for efficient labeling
- Export to Parquet/CSV, ImageFolder, and Ultralytics classification formats
